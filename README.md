# Unexpected useEffect Execution in React 19

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React 19 where a `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array runs more often than expected.  The problem is exacerbated by the added complexity of state updates and component re-renders.

## Problem

The provided `bug.js` file contains a simple counter component. The `useEffect` hook is designed to log a message only once after the initial render.  However, in some cases, it might run multiple times, indicating unexpected re-renders. This can lead to performance issues and unintended side effects.

## Solution

The solution, in `bugSolution.js`, might involve refactoring state updates, using `useMemo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders, or carefully examining the component's logic to identify sources of unintended re-renders. For instance, ensuring that state updates only trigger when necessary is crucial.  Detailed analysis of the component's logic and data flow will pinpoint the root cause.
